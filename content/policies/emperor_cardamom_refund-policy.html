        <h1>Refund policy</h1>

        <h2>Non-Returnable</h2>
        <p>This item is non-returnable due to the consumable nature of the product. The final decision regarding refunds
            or replacements is at our sole discretion.</p>

        <h3>Damaged Packaging</h3>
        <p>Customers are advised not to accept any orders from the delivery partner if the outer packaging is damaged or
            torn.</p>

        <h3>Incorrect or Different Item</h3>
        <p>In the rare event that you receive an incorrect or different item, do not open the pack. We will offer a free
            replacement in this case when the pack is unopened. To process this, we will need to verify the issue by
            requesting a video recording showing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All four sides of the outer carton</li>
            <li>The invoice</li>
            <li>All four sides of the cardamom pack</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This video should capture all necessary details in one single recording, which should be sent to us for
            evaluation.</p>

        <h3>Dissatisfaction with Quality</h3>
        <p>If you are dissatisfied with the quality, an investigation will be conducted to confirm whether the correct
            grade was provided. If the order matches the quality standards and description, no replacement or refund
            will be issued. To raise a quality concern, a video recording must be provided including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All four sides of the outer carton</li>
            <li>The invoice</li>
            <li>All four sides of the cardamom pack</li>
            <li>The cardamom inside the pack (if opened)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This video should capture all necessary details in one single recording for evaluation.</p>

        <h3>Damaged Product (Intact Outer Carton)</h3>
        <p>If a product is damaged but the outer carton was intact, a thorough investigation will be conducted. The same
            video documentation as listed above is required to assess the situation.</p>

        <h3>Closure of Case</h3>
        <p>If no satisfactory response is received from the customer within 3 days for any concerns, the case will be
            closed.</p>
