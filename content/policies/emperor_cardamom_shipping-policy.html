        <h1>Shipping policy</h1>

        <p>All orders will be dispatched within 1-3 working days from the date of confirmation of order placed by the
            customer.</p>

        <p>Information regarding the Airway Bill number / tracking details will be emailed on the registered email
            address after the products are dispatched.</p>

        <p>We have partnered with a leading logistics partner for our domestic and international shipments to ensure
            your orders reach you on time and damage-free.</p>

        <p>For any special delivery requests, please email us at birbal@emperorspices.com and we will try our best to
            accommodate your requests.</p>

        <h2>Domestic Shipping</h2>
        <p>The estimated delivery time for national orders would be 3-6 business days.</p>

        <h2>International Shipping</h2>
        <p>The estimated delivery time for international orders would be 5-12 business days.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, delivery time is subject to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, unexpected
            travel delays from our courier partners due to weather conditions or any political disruptions or strikes.
            We promise to keep you updated every step of the way.</p>

        <p>Your order may be subject to import duties that are levied once the package reaches the destination country.
            An additional charge towards Import, Customs & Taxes may be levied by the Custom authority which will be
            borne by you.</p>

        <p>For international deliveries we currently ship on a DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid) basis, which means product
            prices displayed are exclusive of all taxes and duties. As the recipient, you are liable for all import
            duties, customs and local sales taxes levied by the local customs authorities. Customs policies vary widely
            from country to country, and we recommend contacting the local customs office or their website for further
            information. As an organization, we take no responsibility for non-delivery of orders in case such taxes and
            duties are not accepted and settled by the recipient at the delivery address, and will not provide refunds
            in such cases.</p>

        <h2>Important Advisory for Select Countries</h2>
        <p>In certain countries, including but not limited to Australia, New Zealand, and some EU member states, local
            customs authorities have strict import regulations on food-grade products, including green cardamom.</p>

        <p>To avoid complications, we strongly recommend that international buyers limit their orders to quantities that
            clearly qualify as "for personal consumption" — typically under 2 kg in most countries.</p>

        <p>We cannot be held responsible for shipments held, tested, or destroyed by customs if such procedures are
            imposed. No refunds will be issued in such cases.</p>
