            readily available at home. Savour the delicate flavours of cardamom in this Indian delicacy!</p>

            <li>600 ml - Milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup - Water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup - Basmati rice</li>
            <li>6-8 tsp - Organic sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp - Cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Nuts (Cashew/Almond/Raisin/Pistachio)</li>
            <li>1 tsp - Ghee for frying nuts</li>
            <li>A pinch of Saffron</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash rice a few times and drain completely.</li>
            <li>Chop the nuts and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup water to a pot. This prevents Kheer from getting scorched at the bottom.</li>

            <li>Add drained rice and begin to cook on a medium flame until rice is soft, completely cooked and lightly
                mushy.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and continue to cook until rice kheer turns thick.</li>
            <li>Add cardamom powder, chopped nuts, saffron. Stir and continue to cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve warm or chilled.</li>
