<p><span style="color: #6a7a44;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #6a7a44;"><strong>For Dough</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup - Lukewarm water</li>
<li>2 cups - All purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tbsp - Instant dry yeast</li>
<li>1 - Egg</li>
<li>1 tbsp - Sugar</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>1 cup - Sunflower oil, for frying</li>
<li>1¼ cup - Extra oil, to dip a teaspoon when dropping dough balls into hot oil</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #6a7a44;"><strong>For Syrup</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups - Sugar</li>
<li>2 cups - Water</li>
<li>1 tbsp - Lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #6a7a44;"><strong>How to make Luqaimat:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Start with making the syrup. Mix sugar and water in a pot and bring it to boil.</li>
<li>Let it boil for about 15 minutes until it gets a little sticky and add lemon juice and boil for a further five minutes. Let it cool.</li>
<li>Mix lukewarm water, sugar and yeast in a cup.</li>
<li>Shift flour in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Pour yeast mixture in it and mix with an electric mixer.</li>
<li>Add egg and salt and mix. You will get a soft and sticky batter, a little thicker than a regular cake batter.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl and wait about an hour until it doubles in size.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a deep pot until boiling point.</li>
<li>Take some dough in your hand and squeeze it so that you see a small amount between your thumb and forefinger.</li>
<li>Dip a teaspoon into a little oil and use it to drop that rounded bit of dough into boiling oil.</li>
<li>Fry it until golden for about a minute.</li>
<li>Repeat the same steps until you finish the dough.</li>
<li>Transfer fried dough balls immediately into cold syrup and leave them in it as long as you want. The longer the sweeter.</li>
<li>Take them from syrup when they absorb enough of it and serve warm.</li>
</ol>
