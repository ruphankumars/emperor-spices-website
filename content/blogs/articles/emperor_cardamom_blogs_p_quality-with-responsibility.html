        <h1>QUALITY WITH RESPONSIBILITY</h1>

        <h3>A World of a Problem</h3>
        <p>Research is pointing to the stunning possibility that by 2050, the plastic escaped into the ocean may weigh
            more than all of the sea life within it! A third of all sea turtles and 90% of seabirds are estimated to
            have plastic in their stomachs.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that in the oceans alone, some 100,000 marine animals are killed each year from plastic. 400
            million tonnes of plastic is produced every year; of which 40% is just single use! Of this, more than eight
            million tonnes escape into the sea.</p>

        <h3>A World-Class Solution</h3>
        <p>Emperor Spices Cardamom is a global brand, and with that global status comes global responsibility! The
            world's largest exporter of Alleppey Green Cardamom, the brand has been extremely conscientious of adopting
            healthier and eco-friendly corporate practices.</p>
        <p>The result was the unique 'Aroma-lock' pack. It not only helped maintain the plantation-freshness and aroma
            of the cardamom even years after it reached the end-consumer, it also greatly reduced – if not entirely
            eliminated – the incidence of its packaging adding to the monumental problem of plastic waste.</p>

        <h3>Permanent Packaging</h3>
        <p>Here's how the Aroma-lock mechanism works to eliminate plastic waste and keep the aroma and flavour of the
            cardamom locked in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At the packaging plant, plantation-fresh cardamom pods are quickly packed into Aroma-lock packs and
                immediately sealed shut</li>
            <li>They are then transported in special UV-coated cartons</li>
            <li>The user slides the Aroma-lock back in place after extracting pods</li>
            <li>The same packaging can be used for years without junking</li>
            <li>After cardamom is exhausted, the pack can store other spices</li>
            <li>The material is durable and fully recyclable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>World's Best – in Every Way</h3>
        <p>Emperor Spices Cardamom is one of only two entities that have been conferred the coveted GI Tag for Alleppey
            Green Cardamom. The other being the Spices Board of India. This means that nobody else on the entire planet
            can so much as even claim to produce, market or promote Alleppey Green Cardamom.</p>
        <p>When you buy Emperor Spices, you not only buy quality, you also buy responsibly!</p>
