        <h1>The Colour Grading Guide to Buying Cardamom</h1>

        <p>"One size fits all" goes the old cliché. However, in so many of life's situations, that is never an ideal.
            The same applies to cardamom - different applications require different grades.</p>

        <h3>Emperor Spices's Revolutionary Grading System</h3>
        <p>Emperor Spices Cardamom has introduced a unique five-color grading system based on pod diameter, making it
            easy for consumers to choose the right cardamom for their needs.</p>

        <h3>The Five Grades</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>

            </tr>
