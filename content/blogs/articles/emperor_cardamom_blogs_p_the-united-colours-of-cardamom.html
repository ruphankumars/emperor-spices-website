        <h1>THE UNITED COLOURS OF CARDAMOM</h1>

        <h3>A Legacy of Quality</h3>
        <p>The reputation for the quality of Indian-grown cardamom, specifically from the state of Kerala, can be traced
            to the Raja of Travancore. When he realised that traders came from distant lands in search of this Queen of
            Spices, he decreed that all cardamom produced within his kingdom had to be sold only to his official, who
            then routed the consignments to the main depot at Alleppey which was the kingdom's key port, and to where
            merchants from across the seven seas flocked.</p>
        <p>The Raja further decreed that the best quality pods would be handpicked and earmarked for export. Native
            experts soon developed this into an art, and this tradition was passed down through the generations.</p>
        <p>As the tradition was religiously maintained, Alleppey Green Cardamom became a symbol of world-class quality.
            Of course, at the core of it all, it had to do with the climatic conditions that Kerala is blessed with –
            conditions perfect for the cultivation of superior quality of cardamom.</p>

        <h3>Surviving the Test of Time</h3>
        <p>But cardamom is all about its aroma and flavour. And so, the bigger challenge lay in retaining freshness of
            the produce while transporting over long, arduous journeys to far-flung places around the world. The aroma
            and flavour of cardamom are a result of the oil content within the seeds. When kept exposed, or improperly
            stored, this volatile oil gradually evaporates, and the pods become discoloured. Devoid of the oil, cardamom
            loses its aroma and flavour, and hence its potency. In effect, it becomes useless.</p>
        <p>To prevent such a situation, traders would pack it in layers of sacks, to withstand the long sea journeys.
            Perfecting the packaging became the biggest challenge of them all.</p>
        <p>When Emperor Spices Cardamom came on to the scene, everything changed! During the early R&D stage, the brand
            focused its resources on this vital factor – developing packaging that would maintain plantation freshness,
            not just over transportation journeys, but also while being stored by the end user, over a prolonged period
            of time.</p>

        <h3>Packaging Innovation</h3>
        <p>The brand tackled the issue across two levels. For the shipment journey, special cartons were constructed
            that were UV coated and additionally lined with black paper insulation. Between them, they made the master
            carton an all-weather packaging that could even survive submersion in water; while preventing the pods from
            discolouring during transit.</p>
        <p>That took care of the shipment journey. But something needed to be done to ensure the plantation freshness
            remained sealed in, even after being received and used by the end customer. And so, Emperor Spices Cardamom
            developed special Aroma-lock packs. The contents now didn't need to be transferred to another container for
            storage. Instead, as long as the user sealed back the Aroma-lock mechanism after extracting the necessary
            pods, the remainder would retain their oil content and hence aroma, flavour and potency for years!</p>

        <h3>Pick your Colour!</h3>
        <p>Emperor Spices Cardamom is forever looking at ways to delight its customers. Well aware that different users –
            traders, chefs and retail customers – each have varying needs in the cardamom they buy, the company
            developed a unique grading system… Grading by diameter size – not by quality… the quality always remains
            premium and non-negotiable across every pack colour.</p>
        <p>Size wise, the pods are then sealed into colour-coded packaging for easy identification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purple pack: ~8 mm diameter (largest pods)</li>
            <li>Pink pack: ~7.5 mm diameter</li>
            <li>Green pack: up to 7 mm diameter</li>
            <li>Orange pack: up to 6.5 mm diameter</li>
            <li>Red pack: up to 6 mm diameter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But this is only grading by size and not quality. The quality remains world-class across all packs and sizes
            of pods.</p>

        <h3>The Promise of Quality</h3>
        <p>Quality and transparency are the two things that Emperor Spices never compromises on. No wonder they are the
            brand of choice for discerning buyers right across the world. The brand sells briskly in the Middle East,
            Far East and Europe. In fact, more and more buyers across the world are realising that the higher oil
            content and hence intensity and potency of Emperor Spices's produce actually makes it the more economical
            choice in the long run. Because, for example, just one pod of Emperor Spices's cardamom can achieve the same
            intensity that three pods of an inferior quality can.</p>
