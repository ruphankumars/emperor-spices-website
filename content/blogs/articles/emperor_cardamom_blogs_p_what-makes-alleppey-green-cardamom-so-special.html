        <h1>What makes Alleppey Green Cardamom so special compared to Guatemalan Cardamom?</h1>

        <h3>1. Magic of Soil & Climate</h3>
        <p>Kerala's rich soil and humid tropical climate create the ideal environment for cardamom to grow naturally
            aromatic. Guatemala also produces cardamom in large volumes, but the environmental conditions are very
            different, which affects colour, aroma and flavour.</p>

        <h3>2. Real Secret: Skilled Processing</h3>
        <p>What truly sets Alleppey green cardamom apart is the post-harvest process, especially curing, which is the
            backbone of its quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh cardamom has a high moisture level.</li>
            <li>Expert curing slowly removes this moisture without losing the natural green colour.</li>
            <li>That fresh green colour is the identity of Alleppey Green Cardamom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If curing is not done correctly (as often seen in lower-grade cardamom), the pods turn brownish or yellowish
            and lose aroma.</p>

        <h3>3. Protection From Moisture & Contamination</h3>
        <p>After curing, Alleppey cardamom needs careful packaging to protect it from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moisture re-absorption</li>
            <li>Dust and foreign particles</li>
            <li>Microorganisms</li>
            <li>Insect infestation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This makes packaging a critical step, especially for maintaining its bright colour and aroma.</p>

        <h3>4. Larger Diameter</h3>
        <p>Another big difference lies in the size of the capsules. Alleppey cardamom isn't just long, it has a larger
            diameter, usually 6 mm to 8 mm or sometimes even more.</p>
        <p>A bigger diameter means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More seeds inside</li>
            <li>Higher natural oil content</li>
            <li>Stronger, longer-lasting aroma</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This oil content is a major reason why Alleppey Green Cardamom is preferred in gourmet kitchens, traditional
            sweets and premium export markets.</p>

        <h3>5. Freshness Matters</h3>
        <p>The natural oil in cardamom evaporates quickly if the pods are not packed well. Within 24 hours of exposure,
            the aroma can fade drastically.</p>
        <p>That's why genuine Alleppey Green Cardamom is always:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Packed properly</li>
            <li>Scientifically graded based on size, colour, weight, and oil content</li>
            <li>Protected from air and moisture</li>
        </ul>
