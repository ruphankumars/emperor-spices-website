        <h1>THE ART OF BUYING CARDAMOM</h1>

        <h3>Aroma and Flavour</h3>
        <p>Cardamom doesn't generally spoil, but it can lose its potency – which is its aroma and flavour. Once the
            potency is lost, it's more or less useless as it cannot impart intensity to the dishes it is being added to,
            specifically for the reason of flavour.</p>
        <p>Fresh cardamom is always the best. But it isn't like the cardamom that reaches you was harvested ten minutes
            ago! Thus it all comes down to how the pods were packed, stored and transported. Cardamom that is securely
            handled right from harvesting to packaging to transportation, following stringent operating procedures, will
            best seal in all its natural goodness.</p>
        <p>The simple thumb rule is: greater the diameter of the pod, more the seed ratio, hence greater the oil content
            and thus greater the aroma and flavour. However, this oil is volatile and will gradually evaporate over a
            period of time.</p>

        <h3>Identifying Potency</h3>
        <p>So how does one identify the best-grade cardamom in the first place? It's in the colour of the husks and
            seeds, but easier identified by the aroma. Discoloured husks are an indicator of staleness. Seeds that are
            pale or lighter tan in colour (as opposed to dark brown or black) indicate staleness.</p>
        <p>The simplest test would be to cup a handful of pods and smell it. Instinctively you'll know how much of the
            original freshness is still packed in by the aroma that hits you.</p>

        <h3>World's Best Cardamom</h3>
        <p>All things considered, you can never go wrong when you purchase Emperor Spices Cardamom. This is officially
            certified as the best Alleppey Green Cardamom in the entire world. Emperor Spices is one of only two entities
            on the planet conferred with the coveted GI Tag.</p>
        <p>The pods are specifically measured by diameter and sorted accordingly. Emperor Spices colour-codes its packs:
            the largest pods go into purple aroma-lock packs, the next largest into pink, then green, orange and finally
            red.</p>

        <h3>Sealing in the Potency</h3>
        <p>The unique aroma-lock packs are designed to ensure that even after you start using the contents, the unused
            portion remains fresh – so long as you securely close the locking mechanism after every use.</p>
        <p>Even after aroma-locking each individual pack, they are themselves packed into cartons that have been
            specifically designed to even survive reasonable immersion in water.</p>

        <h3>Cheaper is Never Better</h3>
        <p>Don't get fooled by cheaper varieties. Quality comes at a price. Where you may need three pods of cheaper but
            inferior cardamom to achieve a certain intensity of flavour, you will need just one pod of Emperor Spices
            cardamom to attain the same result. Which only means that Emperor Spices Cardamom is more economical and
            friendly on the pocket.</p>
