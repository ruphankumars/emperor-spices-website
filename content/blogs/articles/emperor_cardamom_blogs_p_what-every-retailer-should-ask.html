        <h1>What Every Retailer Should Ask Before Choosing a Cardamom Supplier</h1>

        <h3>1. What is the source of the Cardamom?</h3>
        <p>The origin of your cardamom is vital because it directly impacts its quality. The best cardamom in the world
            comes from the lush plantations of South India, recognized for its Alleppey Green Cardamom. Look for
            suppliers who can guarantee that their cardamom is sourced from the heart of this region.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cardamom grown in the fertile, high-altitude regions of Kerala tends to have
            a rich aroma, higher oil content and a robust flavour profile, all of which define its premium quality.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices Cardamom has earned the coveted GI Tag (Geographical
            Indication) for Alleppey Green Cardamom, which certifies its authenticity and superior quality.</p>

        <h3>2. How does the Cardamom Manufacturer handle grading and quality control?</h3>
        <p>Cardamom comes in different sizes, and grading by size is a common practice in the industry. However, it's
            crucial to understand that the grading is based on the diameter size of the pod, not the length.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Grading ensures that you get the right cardamom for your intended use,
            whether it's for making high-end teas, premium spice mixes, or large-scale production.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices uses a detailed grading system based on pod diameter,
            with colour-coded packaging: Purple Grade (8mm & above), Pink Grade (7.5mm & above), Green Grade (7mm-8mm),
            Orange Grade (6.5mm-7mm), and Red Grade (6mm-6.5mm).</p>

        <h3>3. What are the packaging methods?</h3>
        <p>Effective packaging is crucial to preserving the freshness and aroma of cardamom.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proper packaging prevents cardamom from losing its intensity and freshness,
            ensuring a longer shelf life.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices pioneered the use of aroma-lock technology, ensuring
            that every cardamom pod retains its natural oils and freshness.</p>

        <h3>4. How does the supplier control moisture and shelf life?</h3>
        <p>Cardamom pods are sensitive to moisture, which can cause mold growth or deterioration of flavor.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Excess moisture can severely affect the shelf life and potency of cardamom.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices ensures that its cardamom is handpicked, graded, and
            properly packed to lock in the aroma and moisture-free condition.</p>

        <h3>5. Do they offer certifications or quality guarantees?</h3>
        <p>Certifications act as an assurance of product quality. Look for suppliers that offer internationally
            recognized quality standards and GI certification.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices Cardamom is GI-certified and also holds a Three Star
            Export House Certificate.</p>

        <h3>6. How reliable is their delivery and distribution?</h3>
        <p>The supplier's ability to deliver your cardamom on time and in excellent condition is paramount.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices, recognized as the Top Exporter of Green Cardamom by
            the Spices Board of India, is trusted by distributors across 25 countries.</p>

        <h3>7. Do they have a proven track record with international retailers?</h3>
        <p>Working with a supplier with a history of successful partnerships with other international retailers can
            reduce the risks involved in sourcing green cardamom.</p>
        <p><strong>Our quality assurance:</strong> Emperor Spices Cardamom is a leading exporter to 25 countries, making
            it a trusted choice for international retailers.</p>

        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
